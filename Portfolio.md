### Portfolio

**About Me** - My name is Kriday Ashok. I’m a Freshman at Amador Valley High School. I’m 14 years old and have lived in Pleasanton all my life (0-14). I love this city very much and can’t imagine a life outside of it.  I’m always curious: always wondering why things work the way they do. That’s also part of the reason why I took up this assignment: to understand conceptually how the lights, fans, computers, and other electrical gadgets work at home. In my free time, I love playing cricket, basketball, and other sports at the park with my friends. I also enjoy biking with them, visiting places I have never seen before. If I’m not outside, then I might be playing on my Nintendo or watching a good Netflix show.  

###  My Education
I went ot Gingerbread preschool, Fairlands Elementary, and Thomas Hart Middle School. Now, in Amador, I hope to make new friends and establish connections with the teachers. I also hope to learn new concepts and improve my writing skills. 

###  My Projects 

Robotics Project -[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FxKLY6FsovewXKSqNRYEbeT-RSY5We8ThnRLw7kwmHg/edit?tab=t.l3l14dcnzzez] -  3134Y Engineering Notebook 2025-2026

This is the notebook where all of our notes, challenges, and ideas went. In the notebook, I helped neaten and write some of our ideas. In class, I work on the bot with my team 3134Y. We are never done, because we are always finding new ways to improve our bot, or trying out other designs that might be meta in the competition. 

###  Extra Curricular Activities  

1.  **Vex V5 Robotics** ⬆️- I have been doing Vex V5 Robotics in Robolabs, Dublin, for a year. It has been a blast to learn new concepts and cool techniques (like fixing friction) to help improve our bot. We placed 14th of 32 teams in a 9-hour-long competition. 

2. **Bingtang Badminton**- I have been training in Bintang badminton for the last 5 years. I love the sport. It allows me to relax; my stress disappears as I hit the bird. I’m currently training under Coach Gabby, and I’m in his advanced team. I attend tournaments and recently qualified for the quarter finals in a High School League tournament. 

3. **Carnatic Music** (Indian Classical Music) (Carnatic Music School - based in Irvine, CA - Teacher - Mrs. Sudha Iyengar) - I have been learning and getting trained in Carnatic Vocal music for the past 10 years. I’m advanced in Carnatic music theory, but I started going to these classes because I’m more interested in singing from the heart. I participated in Bay Area events and student annual performances. 

###  Honors / Awards 

1. I have been an Honor Roll student throughout my middle school (6 - 8 grades)

2. Received an Outstanding Performance Award certificate for my CTE Computer Science elective in 8th grade (Only a few earned it).

3. Received Certificate of Recognition for Character Trait “Integrity” from PUSD school board in 5th grade. Received certificate from PUSD superintendent. (Only very few in the entire district earned it)

4. I am a 1st-degree black belt holder in Taekwondo. Trained at Mach Martial Arts center for over 8 years. 




### Volunteering / Community Service 

1. **City of Pleasanton** - I was selected for Leader In Training Program by the City of Pleasanton, attended their training, and volunteered at Gingerbread preschool in the summer of 2025 (June) for a total of 35 hours.

2. **Kids Against Hunger** - I volunteered and packed food for people in need. We packed more than 12,000 meals for Haiti.

3. **Fund Raiser** - I ran a 5K (I Run They Learn) marathon to raise funds for the Light of Life charity organization.

### My Strengths

- I will persevere through any challenges and obstacles to get to my goal.
- I have great cooperation skills; I love working in teams.
- I’m not defeated by my mistakes, but I learn from them and grow as a result
  

Though I’m new to electrical engineering, I am willing to put in the effort if given this opportunity. I will continue to learn about this topic since this project has ignited a passion for electrical engineering.
